    <h1>User-First Design</h1>
      <p>User stories:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>As a new user, I should be able to register a new account.
          <ul>
            <li>User visits the form/new page of the micro-blogging application.</li>
            <li>User fills out their full name, uploads a profile picture, enters a username/handle, and a password.</li>
            <li>User then clicks the 'Register' button, and their account is now created.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>As a normal user, I should be able to follow someone.
          <ul>
            <li>User visits the message index page, which has a feed of messages from all users.</li>
            <li>User clicks on the 'Follow' button to the right of the message for whoever they want to follow. The user is now following that person.</li>
            <li>Your feed now updates with 'You are now following [user]'.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>As a normal user, I should be able to post a message.
          <ul>
            <li>User visits the message new page.</li>
            <li>User fills out the 'New Message' form with a message that allows for #hashtags and @mentions.</li>
            <li>User then clicks the 'Post' button that publishes their new message on their account, and this message is now visible to any user that follows them.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>As a normal user, I should be able to see messages from other people that I follow.
          <ul>
            <li>User visits the messages index, which has a feed of messages from users that they follow.</li>
            <li>User can visit a specific person's page and see messages from just that person. You would need to click on the person's username in the feed.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>As a normal user, I should be able to see all messages that use the same hashtag.
          <ul>
            <li>User visits their account home page with the message feed.</li>
            <li>User navigates to the top right corner of the page and enters a hashtag to search for.</li>
            <li>A new page is brought up with a list of messages that contain the hashtag being searched for. If there are no messages with that hashtag, a message appears on the page telling the user there are no messages containing that hashtag.</li>
            <li>User can also click on a hashtag in the message feed, which brings them to the same page containing a list of messages that used that same hashtag.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </div>

    <h1>Data-First Design</h1>
      <p>Resources needed for the application and what data each resource would need:
